        A musical instrument is a device created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any
        object that produces sound (including the larynx) can be considered a musical instrumentâ€”it is
        through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. A person who plays a musical
        instrument is known as an instrumentalist. The history of musical instruments dates to the
        beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for rituals, such as a
        horn to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually
        developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved
        in step with changing applications and technologies. </h2>
