        Every free nation of the world has its own flag. It is a symbol of a free country. The
        National Flag of India was adopted in its present form during the meeting of Constituent
        Assembly held on the 22 July 1947, a few days before India's independence from the British
        on 15 August, 1947. It served as the national flag of the Dominion of India between 15 August
        1947 and 26 January 1950 and that of the Republic of India thereafter. In India, the term
        "tricolour" refers to the Indian national flag.

        The National flag of India is a horizontal tricolor of deep saffron (kesari) at the top, white in
        the middle and dark green at the bottom in equal proportion. The ratio of width of the flag to
        its length is two to three. In the centre of the white band is a navy blue wheel which represents
        the chakra. Its design is that of the wheel which appears on the abacus of the Sarnath Lion Capital
        of Ashoka. Its diameter approximates to the width of the white band and it has 24 spokes.


        Colours of the Flag
        In the national flag of India the top band is of Saffron colour, indicating the strength and
        courage of the country. The white middle band indicates peace and truth with Dharma Chakra. The
        last band is green in colour shows the fertility, growth and auspiciousness of the land.


        The Chakra
        This Dharma Chakra depicted the "wheel of the law" in the Sarnath Lion Capital made by the
        3rd-century BC Mauryan Emperor Ashoka. The chakra intends to show that there is life in movement
        and death in stagnation.


        Flag Code
        On 26th January 2002, the Indian flag code was modified and after several years of independence,
        the citizens of India were finally allowed to hoist the Indian flag over their homes, offices and
        factories on any day and not just National days as was the case earlier. Now Indians can proudly
        display the national flag any where and any time, as long as the provisions of the Flag Code are
        strictly followed to avoid any disrespect to the tricolour. For the sake of convenience, Flag Code
        of India, 2002, has been divided into three parts. Part I of the Code contains general description
        of the National Flag. Part II of the Code is devoted to the display of the National Flag by members
        of public, private organizations, educational institutions, etc. Part III of the Code relates to
        display of the National Flag by Central and State governments and their organisations and agencies.
